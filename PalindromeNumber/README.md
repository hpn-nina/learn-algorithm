<h1>Palindrome Number </h1>
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. 
For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 4:
Input: x = -101
Output: false


Constraints:
    `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
